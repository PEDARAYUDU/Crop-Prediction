          <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Farmers frequently face challenges in selecting the most suitable
            crops for their fields, often depending on advice from peers and
            government guidelines. However, these decisions typically overlook
            essential factors such as soil characteristics, pH levels, weather
            conditions, and market prices, leading to lower yields and
            profitability. As a result, there's a need for a more data-driven
            approach that ensures optimal crop selection for both economic gain
            and environmental health.
          </p>
          <h1>Project overview</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">
            We are developing a Django-based web application that integrates a
            machine learning model to predict or suggest the most suitable crop
            for a farmer's field. This application leverages data on soil
            characteristics, weather conditions, and market prices to provide
            tailored crop recommendations, aiming to optimize both profitability
            and sustainability.
          </p>
          <img src="{% static 'images/model_overView.jpg' %}" alt="" />
          <h1>Data Description</h1>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The dataset consists of 4,400 rows and 9 features, including values
            for nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, temperature, humidity, pH,
            rainfall, price, and crop name. The dataset is equally distributed
            across different crops, with 200 rows allocated to each crop.
          </p>
          <img src="{% static 'images/data_set.jpg' %}" alt="" />
          <h1>Model Building</h1>

          <img src="{% static 'images/model_pipeline.jpg' %}" alt="" />
          <p class="paragraph">
            Using the machine learning pipeline illustrated in the image, we
            implemented various classification algorithms to predict the most
            suitable crop based on the dataset features. The algorithms employed
            include Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support
            Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), XGBoost, and Logistic
            Regression. Each algorithm was trained, validated, and evaluated
            within this pipeline to determine the best model for accurate and
            reliable crop classification, ensuring the final model serves
            farmers' needsÂ effectively.
          </p>

          <h1>Performance and Evaluation</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The bar plot illustrates the accuracy of different machine learning
            models used for crop classification. The Random Forest model
            achieved the highest accuracy at 98.75%, closely followed by XGBoost
            at 98.41% and SVM at 98.18%. The Decision Tree model also performed
            well, with an accuracy of 97.05%. Logistic Regression and Naive
            Bayes models had lower accuracies, at 91.82% and 89.66%,
            respectively. This suggests that ensemble methods like Random Forest
            and XGBoost are particularly effective for this classification task.
          </p>
          <img src="{% static 'images/result.jpg' %}" alt="" />
          <p class="paragraph">
            The Random Forest model demonstrated outstanding performance in
            classifying crops based on the given features, achieving 100%
            accuracy on the test set as indicated by this confusion matrix. This
            suggests that the model is highly reliable and can be trusted for
            crop prediction tasks in this context.
          </p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The Crop Suggestion System (CSS) project successfully leverages
            advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, SVM,
            XGBoost, and others, to accurately predict the most suitable crops
            for farmers based on key features like soil nutrients, weather
            conditions, and market prices. With a dataset equally distributed
            among various crops, the Random Forest model achieved near-perfect
            accuracy, as demonstrated by the confusion matrix, indicating the
            model's robustness in making precise predictions without
            misclassification. This project not only empowers farmers with
            data-driven crop selection but also enhances agricultural
            productivity and sustainability by integrating environmental factors
            and economic considerations into decision-making.
